######### SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION ######################################
# This block only serves in a very specific condition:
# I only configured one node (kubenode0) to be the only one that's
# accessible from the outside of the kubernetes cluster.
#
# I can't access kubenode1 o3 kubenode2 from my host machine.
# BUT I can access those nodes from kubenode0, therefore I instruct ssh to use
# kubenode0 as proxy
#
# Feel free to remove all this block if you don't have such configuration
# and you can access all your nodes from your host machine.
# BTW: this configuration is called 'SSH JUMP HOST or BASTION'
# 

# Group for the proxy server
